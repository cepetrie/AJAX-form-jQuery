AJAX Form: For this assignment, you'll build an AJAX based form, which will give the user a series of three questions. These questions must appear one at a time, and the data retrieved from the question must be stored for submission via AJAX.

3 Questions: These questions will allow the user to 'pick a pet' for adoption based upon an either/or scenario.  

Behold the Pet: Once the user makes the selections, you would use the power of AJAX to retrieve a picture of the pet from the server.

Submission: Your finished assignment will be a single page application, that uses a form and AJAX and only shows one question at a time, whilst delivering the image from a remote server, along with a profile of the pet!
